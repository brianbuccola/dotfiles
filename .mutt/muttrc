# Hooks
folder-hook "All Mail" 'macro index d "<save-message>=gmail/Trash<enter>" "send message to trash"'
folder-hook "All Mail" 'macro index <Esc>d "<tag-thread><tag-prefix><save-message>=gmail/Trash<enter>" "send thread to trash"'
folder-hook !"All Mail" 'macro index d "<delete-message>" "archive message (INBOX) or remove label (elsewhere)"'
folder-hook !"All Mail" 'macro index <Esc>d "<delete-message>" "archive thread (INBOX) or remove label (elsewhere)"'
## NB: the above hook removes label, i.e. removes msg from current (non-All Mail) folder.
## This amounts to archiving (leaving a copy in All Mail), EXCEPT in the case of Trash.
## When in Trash, this macro deletes the msg for good.
